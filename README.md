# NGO_Network


ngo_script.py initiates a call and response for the user - 
You will be asked to fill out desired aspects of NGOs that are stored in the dataframe including: age of NGO, language spoken, country of activity and if you'd like to be strict about all features being present in the search.

It then allows you to explore NGO names in a scrolling basis before getting a recommendation, and then opens a word cloud description of the chosen NGO's mission statement. You are able to interact with and save this file, and then Excel file with top recommendations will be saved to your computer.


Below is an example of the wordcloud and dataframe produced by the function:
